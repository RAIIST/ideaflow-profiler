# IdeaFlowDX Profiler & Automated FAQ

The IdeaFlowDX Profiler helps developers drill into low-level details of individual "Idea Flow Maps" recorded with the data collection plugin (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/9239), in order to find out what's causing productivity loss, and look for opportunities for improvement.

When the Idea Flow Map profiles are annotated with notes, the details of the "Troubleshooting Journey" are automatically saved to a searchable FAQ that's indexed along with the code.

The project is written in Angular2, and is dependent on the "/ideaflow" service, located here: http://github.com/openmastery/ideaflow, and deployed here: http://om-ideaflow.herokuapp.com
